# Tutorial 5: Good coding practices

This tutorial serves as a collection of both general programming tips and tricks, and specific Pythonic (or ADAic) tips to help improve code quality, readability and extensibility. It is not a thorough lecture on programming, but only serves as an introduction to what good coding practices are and where more good practices can be found. The tutorial is most useful for beginners to Python (more so beginners to programming), but nevertheless could also prove useful to more experienced programmers.
